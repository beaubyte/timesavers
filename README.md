# timesavers
Timesavers is a website built for a TaaS (Time as a Service) company that sells the ability to go back in time to people. It offers premade places found it time to travel to, but also allows the ability to put in a custom order for a specific place in time. This project was built for a Web Development class taken in Spring of 2025. It uses PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and JavaScript.

### Dependencies
`apache2`
`mysql-server`
`php8.4`

### Deployment
Copy files to your website content directory, ensuring that PHP has been enabled for your Apache web server.

> Why are they no folders in the project structure?
The virtual environment this project was built for didn't play well with folders, so it was easiest for demonstration to have all files in the root directory. In a final website design, the project would be refactored to include subdirectories.
